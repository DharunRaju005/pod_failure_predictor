# Kubernetes Pod Failure Detection Project Documentation

This document provides an in-depth overview of the Kubernetes Pod Failure Detection project, a machine learning-based solution designed to predict pod failures in a Kubernetes cluster. The project leverages metrics from Prometheus, a pre-trained XGBoost model, and a Flask-based API to classify pod statuses, enhancing cluster reliability and operational efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Kubernetes Pod Failure Detection project aims to proactively identify and predict pod failures within a Kubernetes cluster using real-time metrics and machine learning. It integrates with Prometheus for metrics collection and employs an XGBoost model to classify pod statuses into seven categories: `ContainerCreating`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Error`, `NotFound`, `Pending`, `Running`, and `Unknown`. The system is deployed as a Flask application within a Docker container, providing a scalable and accessible prediction API.

### 🎯 Objectives
- **Predict Pod Failures:** Classify pod statuses using real-time metrics to anticipate failures.
- **Monitor Cluster Health:** Utilize Prometheus to collect and analyze pod and node metrics.
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** Deliver predictions with confidence levels and probability distributions for operational decision-making.
