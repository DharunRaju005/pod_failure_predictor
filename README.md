## Description
Pod Failure Prediction is a machine learning solution designed to predict pod failures in a Kubernetes environment. By leveraging historical data on pod statuses and system metrics, our XGBoost-based model classifies pod statuses into categories such as "Running," "CrashLoopBackOff," or "Unknown." This project empowers Kubernetes administrators to proactively address potential failures, enhancing system reliability and performance.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict pod failures using machine learning, enabling preemptive action in Kubernetes clusters. Developed for a hackathon, it showcases a full pipeline from data collection to model evaluation, implemented in Python using Google Colab. The solution addresses real-world challenges like class imbalance and feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.

## Architecture
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Collection:** Historical pod data is sourced from a CSV file stored in Google Drive.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, sorting, and encoding of raw data for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features to capture failure patterns.
4. **Model Training:** Training an XGBoost classifier with optimized parameters.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Tools Used:**
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Google Colab:** Development environment.
- **XGBoost:** Machine learning model.
- **Hugging Face:** Model hosting (if applicable).
- **Google Drive:** Data and model storage.
